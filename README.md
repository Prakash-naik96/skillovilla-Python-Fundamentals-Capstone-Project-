# Python-Fundamentals-Capstone-Project-
🐍 Python Fundamentals Capstone Project (2025)
Objective:
Simulate real-world data processing tasks by handling multi-source datasets using core Python, Pandas, and NumPy.

📌 Project Summary:

Situation: Provided with three distinct datasets representing employee, project, and seniority data to replicate real-time business analysis.

Task: Perform end-to-end data processing including cleaning, transformation, conditional logic, and business rule application.

Action: Created DataFrames from scratch, filled missing values using logic, split and merged tables, applied promotions/demotions, and summarized project costs.

Result: Completed all 10 structured tasks in a single, well-commented Jupyter Notebook, demonstrating clear understanding of data handling and manipulation in Python.

📁 Deliverables:

.ipynb file with clean, commented code.

CSV exports of the processed datasets.

Optional documentation/report explaining the business logic used per task.
